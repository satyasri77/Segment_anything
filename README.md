# Segment_anything

Segment Anything Model (SAM) is released by Meta AI recently for segmenting the objects and identifying the pixels belong to the objects. The model is built using 11 Million images and 1.1 billion masks, the source code and model related information can be found using [github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) link.

The model is predicting very accurate boundaries and masks of the objects and generalizing very well for different applications in computer vision. 

The attached are the results of the masks of objects for the images.
