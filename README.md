# Segment Anything Model (SAM)

Segment Anything Model (SAM) is released by Meta AI recently for segmenting the objects and identifying the pixels belong to those objects. The model is built using 11 Million images and 1.1 billion masks, the source code, [dataset](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything/) and model related information can be found using this [github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) link.

The model very well generalized and is able to predict highly accurate boundaries and masks of the objects and will be quite useful for wide range of applications in computer vision. 

The results of the model are pretty amazing.
